# HackMIT Project

Problem. Metaverse, VR, and games today lack true immersion. Even in the Metaverse, as a person, you exist completely phantom waist down. The movement of your elbows is predicted by an algorithm, and can look unstable and jittery. Worst of all, you have to use joycons to do something like waterbend, or spawn a fireball in your open palm. 

Solution. An iPhone powered full-body 3D tracking system. Every aspect of the way that you move, an avatar tailored to your body, and it costs practically nothing.
